    \n\nI love fish.
    \n\nThe kind that is alive ans swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
    \nFun Fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
    \nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish, Grilled fish, Smoked fish, Poached fish - not to much.
    \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
    \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    \n\nOnce, When I was camping in Cananda, and very hungry,I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
    \n\nI\'ll be happy to tech you how to make your own aquarium.
    \nYou shoukd ask someone else about fishing, though.</string>
